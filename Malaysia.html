Peninsular Malaysia shares a land and maritime border with Thailand in the north and maritime borders with Singapore in the south, Vietnam in the northeast, and Indonesia in the west. East Malaysia shares land and maritime borders with Brunei and Indonesia and a maritime border with the Philippines and Vietnam. Kuala Lumpur is the national capital and largest city while Putrajaya is the seat of federal government. With a population of over 30 million, Malaysia is the world's 44th most populous country.

    <h2>Tops Place have to visit</h2>

    <img src="https://www.touropia.com/gfx/b/2017/05/penang_street_art.jpg" class="img1">
    <h3>Penang</h3>
    <p class="FSize">Dishes that Penang is best known for include char kway teow, asam laksa, and cendol. Hawker food can be found in nearly any street of Penang, but to find everything in one place, stop by hawker centres such as the Gurney Drive Hawker Centre. Steeped in history and adorned with modern skyscrapers, Penang is a cultural cauldron of tradition and modernity. Definitely a world-class holiday destination and a must-visit for any self-respecting traveller in Malaysia!</p>

    <h3>Melaka</h3>
    <p class="FSize">Malacca as known as Melaka, it is a famous tourist destination with a rich cultural heritage, subsequent to the colonial rule of Portuguese, Dutch and British. Traditional culture is carried on by the Baba & Nyonya who are descendants of the Chinese delegates of Ming Dynasty where they emigrated from China and settled here. Having been an important trading port during Malaysia’s colonial era, you will also find remnants of the past here, such as the Portuguese Settlement and the Dutch Heritage Trail. And if you’re a fan of night markets, then the Jonker Street Night Market is surely an experience not to be missed!</p>

    <h3>Kuala Lumpur</h3>
    <p class="FSize">The metropolitan capital of Malaysia is arguably the most populous city in the entire country, so you can be sure that there is much to do here. The Central Market is a bustling location of activity as vendors peddle their wares ranging from traditional handicraft to hip apparel and, most importantly, local street food. Within the market is also a space called the Annexe where local artists occasionally hold galleries showcasing their work. For a fun night out on the city, visit Bukit Bintang which is the main pubbing/clubbing district of the city. Here you’ll find plenty of establishments with rustic atmospheres and homey ambience to enjoy a few drinks with friends. And of course, no trip to K.L. is ever complete without a snapshot of the iconic Petronas Twin Towers.</p>
